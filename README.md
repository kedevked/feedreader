# FeedReader

This project is a blog for udacians ðŸ™‚.

## Dependencies

- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) for project testing

- [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) for HTML templating

- [jquery](http://jquery.com/) for DOM selection

## Testing

To launch the app click on the index.html file and see the magic in your browser.

At the bottom of the page, Jasmine displays how many tests have successfully passed for the project.

### How to run the tests

When all the page has successfully loaded, all the tests are executed and displayed at the bottom of
the page.
If after a modification in the code, one needs to run a specific test in the list of those displayed, 
one could just click on the row indicating the test to pass. 
The test list is indented. So one could choose also to execute a series of tests, AKA test suite. In 
that case, one simply need to click on the test suite that contains all the tests to execute

### Tests executed

Here are some of the tests executed:

 - Test that the feed content change once a feed has loaded
 - Test to ensure that the menu navbar is hidden by default but can appear if click on the menu-icon
 - Test to ensure that after loading the page, there are contents to display
 - Test to ensure that the feeds have valid Url and name

Happily all the tests have passed so far ...
